    <h1>Dots and Boxes</h1>
    <p class="welcome">
      Welcome to Dots and Boxes!Can you outsmart your opponent and trap the most
      boxes? Let's find out!
    </p>
    <h2 class="how-to">How to Play</h2>
    <p class="instructions">
      To play, you and your opponent take turns drawing lines between two
      adjacent dots, either up, down, left, or right. When you complete the
      fourth side of a square, you own that box â€” and you even get another turn!
      Keep going until all the boxes are filled. Whoever ends up with the most
      boxes at the end is the winner and reigning box champion. Think ahead,
      because one careless move can set your opponent up to grab a whole chain
      of boxes! Use your wits, make your moves count, and aim to trap more boxes
      than your rival. Ready to rule the grid?
